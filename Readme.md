  SafeFrames Reference Implementation
========================================================

SafeFrames is a specification that allows a publishing website
to display advertising content in a way that does not allow
for advertisements to compromise the security or integrity
of the publisher's site and content.

SafeFrames allows advertisers to obtain data, such as
viewability and take advantage of advanced features such
as expansion, at the publisher's discretion.
